Pneumonia Detection Project
📋 Overview
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
It aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing fast, accurate, and reliable diagnostic support.

🚀 Models Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification

Random Forest Classifier for ensemble learning

XGBoost Classifier for gradient boosting optimization

Vision Transformer (ViT) for state-of-the-art image understanding

🛠️ Technologies
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

OpenCV

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

📂 Dataset
The project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available from Kaggle.

Training set: Normal and Pneumonia labeled images

Test set: Used for model evaluation
git clone https://github.com/hibames/pneumonia-detection-
.git

 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for better performance

Implementing model explainability with Grad-CAM

Deployment using a simple web application (Streamlit/Flask)
